<h4>I could not solve the issue in the edit page. However, I was able to validate some form elements. If you just enter outtime and closingKm, on clicking the edit button 
it'll calculate and fill totalTripHr and TotalTripKm using the script I wrote. Also if the closingKm is less than openingKm then it'll alert the user.</h4>
